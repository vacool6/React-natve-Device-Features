# Device features
This project demonstrates how to explore and interact with native device features such as Map, Camera, GPS, and more using Expo in React Native. It provides easy-to-use examples and utilizes Expo's managed workflow to access these features.

## Features
Map Integration: Display and interact with maps using the deviceâ€™s location.
Camera Access: Capture photos and videos using the device's camera.
GPS: Access the device's geolocation data.

We use SQLite for in-device storage.
